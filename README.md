# byebrid_site
For development of byebrid.com

**Notes**
=========
- Need to ensure that ckeditor is not accessible to anyone but admins since it is not escaped safely and so could be abused.

**To do**
=========
- Make it so if user searches for Europe blog post, they get some feedback of what exactly they put in up top (i.e. Search results for "Geneva"). Not sure if this will necessitate brand new template just for search queries (I assume not but not quite sure how to implement yet).
